This day is mostly dedicated to try completing a first routing round in KiCAD.
I think I connected all the wires, I just have 144 violations to go

# Done

- Few documentation
- Close tons of browser tabs
- Keep interacting with the amazing Discord Absolem Club community


# For the next iteration

- Ergogen yml file --> get all footprint: miss the board to board connector and a reversible rp2040 footprint. Add some via in the yaml

- Explore some solution to automate some steps: KiCAD file generation from command line, manage external footprints, generate or lint stuff with github actions and ergogen in a container or at least from the command line, autorouting

- KiCAD --> rules files, export gerber, upload to production.

- FW --> rp2040 split keyboard support

- Dev kiy HW --> create or improve a dev platform: has to have a small key matrix (2x2 or 3x3 or maybe 2x3 or 3x4), board to board connector, lcd, led, sensors (I'd like to play with 9DOF), rotary encoder.
