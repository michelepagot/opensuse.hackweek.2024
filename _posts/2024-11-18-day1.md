Everything started this summer with some annoying and persistent tingling in one of my hand and arm.
That was the initial motivation to get more interested in ergonomic work gadgets,
and from that to split keyboards.

First step is get some measurments of my hands: it is like stick some paper on the floor and have fun with some felt-tips.

After that I moved the image in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) mostly to be able to measure distances and angles

And now what?

There are various approaces you can take at this point:

- hand wire your board: so create a mechanical support for your switches. It could be a 3D printed plastic plate,
a hand or laser cut wood panel, a PCB with mechanical only functionality.
Whatever you do has to be a "panel with some rectangular holes" where to fit your switches.  

- design a PCB from scratch in some CAD tools. Starting from a schematic, down to footprint 
and trace routing, to end with a bunch of gerber files.

- everything has to be code!!!
