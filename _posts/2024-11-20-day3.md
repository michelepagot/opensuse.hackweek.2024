This day is mostly dedicated to get my hand dirty: 
idea is to building a 2x2 key matrix --> welcome to nne

Look at ZKM and how to configure it --> https://github.com/michelepagot/zmk-config-nne

Get the FW built by github, try to flash it: get matrix scan pulse but no keys to the PC

Get in contact with ceoloide, an Ergogen maintainer, about net issue.
