This day is mostly dedicated to get my hand dirty:

# Take it out from CAD in advance

Here is like a MX switch socket reversible footprint looks like in KiCad PCB editor

![Image]({{ "/assets/img/switch_reversible_cluster.png" | relative_url }})

Does not fully make sense to me:
- there are holes with pure mechanical purpose
- there are SMD pads
- there are true holes components
- red and blue copper plane
- I added a via

So at some point a created a physical model of it using a Post-It

![Image]({{ "/assets/img/switch_socket_draw_back.jpg" | relative_url }})

Was helpful but not enough. So get my drill!!!

# nne
Idea is to building a 2x2 key matrix: welcome to **nne**


# ZKM
Look at ZKM and how to configure it --> [zmk-config-nne](https://github.com/michelepagot/zmk-config-nne)

Get the FW built by github, try to flash it: get matrix scan pulse but no keys to the PC

# Ergogen net issue
Get in contact with `ceoloide`, an Ergogen maintainer, about net issue.
