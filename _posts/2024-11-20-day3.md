This day is mostly dedicated to get my hand dirty:

# Take it out from CAD in advance

Here is like a MX switch socket reversible footprint looks like in KiCad PCB editor

![Image]({{ "/assets/img/switch_reversible_cluster.png" | relative_url }})

Does not fully make sense to me:
- there are holes with pure mechanical purpose
- there are SMD pads
- there are true holes components
- red and blue copper plane
- I added a via

So at some point a created a physical model of it using a Post-It

![Image]({{ "/assets/img/switch_socket_draw_front.jpg" | relative_url }})

![Image]({{ "/assets/img/switch_socket_draw_back.jpg" | relative_url }})

Was helpful but not enough. So get my drill!!!

# nne
I already have some components:

Idea is to building a 2x2 key matrix: welcome to **nne**

Let start easy trying to fit:
- one socket,
- one switch
- and sandwich the PCB in between.

It needs 3 holes

Easy right ...?
![Image]({{ "/assets/img/nee_1sw_side.jpg" | relative_url }})

No not really!
![Image]({{ "/assets/img/nee_1sw_top.jpg" | relative_url }})

Then scale out to 4
![Image]({{ "/assets/img/nee_holes_4.jpg" | relative_url }})

Now fit all sockets and switches
![Image]({{ "/assets/img/nee_sokets.jpg" | relative_url }})

Start building the matrix, beginning from the columns and diodes
![Image]({{ "/assets/img/nee_sokets_diodes.jpg" | relative_url }})

Then the rows and connect them to the controller
![Image]({{ "/assets/img/nee_rows.jpg" | relative_url }})


# ZKM
Look at ZKM and how to configure it --> [zmk-config-nne](https://github.com/michelepagot/zmk-config-nne)

Get the FW built by github, try to flash it: get matrix scan pulse but no keys to the PC

# Ergogen net issue
Get in contact with `ceoloide`, an Ergogen maintainer, about net issue.
